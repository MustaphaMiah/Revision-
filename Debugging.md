### Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes

Another syntax error to be aware of is that all opening parentheses, brackets, curly braces, and quotes have a closing pair. Forgetting a piece tends to happen when you're editing existing code and inserting items with one of the pair types. Also, take care when nesting code blocks into others, such as adding a callback function as an argument to a method.

One way to avoid this mistake is as soon as the opening character is typed, immediately include the closing match, then move the cursor back between them and continue coding. Fortunately, most modern code editors generate the second half of the pair automatically.

### Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes
JavaScript allows the use of both single (') and double (") quotes to declare a string. Deciding which one to use generally comes down to personal preference, with some exceptions.

Having two choices is great when a string has contractions or another piece of text that's in quotes. Just be careful that you don't close the string too early, which causes a syntax error.

Here are some examples of mixing quotes:
```
// These are correct:
const grouchoContraction = "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.";
const quoteInString = "Groucho Marx once said 'Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.'";
// This is incorrect:
const uhOhGroucho = 'I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.';
```
Of course, it is okay to use only one style of quotes. You can escape the quotes inside the string by using the backslash (\) escape character:
```
// Correct use of same quotes:
const allSameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';
```
### Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator
Branching programs, i.e. ones that do different things if certain conditions are met, rely on if, else if, and else statements in JavaScript. The condition sometimes takes the form of testing whether a result is equal to a value.

This logic is spoken (in English, at least) as "if x equals y, then ..." which can literally translate into code using the =, or assignment operator. This leads to unexpected control flow in your program.

As covered in previous challenges, the assignment operator (=) in JavaScript assigns a value to a variable name. And the == and === operators check for equality (the triple === tests for strict equality, meaning both value and type are the same).

The code below assigns x to be 2, which evaluates as true. Almost every value on its own in JavaScript evaluates to true, except what are known as the "falsy" values: false, 0, "" (an empty string), NaN, undefined, and null.
```
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
if (x = y) {
  // this code block will run for any value of y (unless y were originally set as a falsy)
} else {
  // this code block is what should run (but won't) in this example
}
```
### Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call
When a function or method doesn't take any arguments, you may forget to include the (empty) opening and closing parentheses when calling it. Often times the result of a function call is saved in a variable for other use in your code. This error can be detected by logging variable values (or their types) to the console and seeing that one is set to a function reference, instead of the expected value the function returns.
```
The variables in the following example are different:

function myFunction() {
  return "You rock!";
}
let varOne = myFunction; // set to equal a function
let varTwo = myFunction(); // set to equal the string "You rock!"
```
