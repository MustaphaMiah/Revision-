Revising HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript

                                                                                          

Notes:

The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.

In addition to pixels, you can also specify the border-radius using a percentage.

In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.
There are several benefits to using id attributes: You can use an id to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.

Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties individually, you can specify them all in one line, like this:
padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;

The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units of length. For example, in and mm refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.

Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value. For example, em is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size.

The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.
The box-shadow property takes values for

* offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
* offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
* blur-radius,
* spread-radius and
* color, in that order.

The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.
Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.
Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:

The text-transform property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.
The following table shows how the different text-transformvalues change the example text "Transform me".

Value	Result
lowercase	"transform me"
uppercase	"TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize	"Transform Me"
initial	Use the default value
inherit	Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none	Default: Use the original text

CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function. Here is the general syntax:
background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);
The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a vertical gradient and 45deg is angled like a backslash. The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.
Example:
background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));

By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

You may recall from an earlier challenge that the box-shadow property takes values for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.

animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.

@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene.

``` <style>
  div {
    height: 40px;
    width: 70%;
    background: black;
    margin: 50px auto;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }

  #rect {
    animation-name: rainbow; 
    animation-duration: 4s;  
  }

  @keyframes rainbow {
    0% {
      background-color: blue; 
    }
    50% {
      background-color: green;
    }
    100% {
      background-color: yellow;
    }
  }
  }

</style>
<div id="rect"></div>
```
You can use CSS @keyframes to change the color of a button in its hover state.

Here's an example of changing the background colour of the button element on hover:

``` 
<style>
  button {
    border-radius: 5px;
    color: white;
    background-color: #0F5897;
    padding: 5px 10px 8px 10px;
  }

  button:hover {
    animation-name: background-color;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
  }

   @keyframes background-color {
    100% {
      background-color: #4791d0;
    }
  }



</style>

<button>Register</button>
```
Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:
animation-iteration-count: 3;


Applied Accessibility

It's likely that you've seen an alt attribute on an img tag in other challenges. Alt text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative for it. This helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an example:

<img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo">

People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.

Good alt text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include an alt attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.

Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values.

HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.

By default, a browser renders these elements similarly to the humble div. However, using them where appropriate gives additional meaning in your markup. The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content. Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.

The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic of your page. It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.

article is another one of the new HTML5 elements that adds semantic meaning to your markup. article is a sectioning element, and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.

The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.


The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the header tag. It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.

header shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with main, allowing assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content.

Note: The header is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.

The nav element is another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation. This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.

If there are repeated site links at the bottom of the page, it isn't necessary to markup those with a nav tag as well. Using a footer (covered in the next challenge) is sufficient.

Similar to header and nav, the footer element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page.

HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on

Example:

```
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
```

Note: Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.

HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption. Used together, these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the figure.

For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for users with visual impairments. Another challenge covers how to move a table version of the chart's data off-screen (using CSS) for screen reader users.

Here's an example - note that the figcaption goes inside the figure tags and can be combined with other elements:HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption. Used together, these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption.

For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for users with visual impairments. Another challenge covers how to move a table version of the chart's data off-screen (using CSS) for screen reader users.

Here's an example - note that the figcaption goes inside the figure tags and can be combined with other elements:

```
<figure>
  <img src="roundhouseDestruction.jpeg" alt="Photo of Camper Cat executing a roundhouse kick">
  <br>
  <figcaption>
    Master Camper Cat demonstrates a proper Muay Thai form of a roundhouse kick.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

Improving accessibility with semantic HTML markup applies to using both appropriate tag names as well as attributes. The next several challenges cover some important scenarios using attributes in forms.

The label tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The for attribute on a label tag explicitly associates that label with the form control and is used by screen readers.

You learned about radio buttons and their labels in a lesson in the Basic HTML section. In that lesson, we wrapped the radio button input element inside a label element along with the label text in order to make the text clickable. Another way to achieve this is by using the for attribute as explained in this lesson.

The value of the for attribute must be the same as the value of the id attribute of the form control. Here's an example:

<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>

JavaScript Revision 

In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.

For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.

myVariable = 5;

This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator. 

It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;

Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

Best Practice
Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example

5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)
Note
The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

myVar = myVar + 5;

to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

var myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar); // Returns 6

Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;

The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;

will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;

The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;

Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;

Previously we have used the code

var myName = "your name";

"your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";

This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:

Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".

String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.

doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; 
singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';
The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. Another use for it would be saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string.

conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"';
However, this becomes a problem if you need to use the outermost quotes within it. Remember, a string has the same kind of quote at the beginning and end. But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error.

goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"'; // Throws an error
In the goodStr above, you can use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character. Note
The backslash \ should not be confused with the forward slash /. They do not do the same thing.

Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters:

To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage return.
To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.
We learned this in the previous challenge.
Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.

In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

"Alan Peter".length; // 10

For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property.

Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

For example, the following code:

```var myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
```

cannot change the value of myStr to "Job", because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

```
var myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";
```
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String:
You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the var firstName = "Charles" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

#### Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like this: [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]. This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

#### We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.



Example
```
var array = [50,60,70];
array[0]; // equals 50
var data = array[1];  // equals 60
```

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.

Example
```
var ourArray = [50,40,30];
ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]
```
#### Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes

One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example

```
var arr = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9],
  [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
];
```

```
arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]
arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11
```

#### Manipulate Arrays With push()
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.

.push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.

```
var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.push(4);
// arr is now [1,2,3,4]
```

#### Manipulate Arrays With pop()
Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

.pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

Any type of entry can be "popped" off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

#### Manipulate Arrays With shift()
pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?

That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

#### Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:
```
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message "Hello World" on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

#### Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:
```
function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
```
Then we can call testFun: testFun("Hello", "World"); We have passed two arguments, "Hello" and "World". Inside the function, param1 will equal "Hello" and param2 will equal "World". Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

#### Global Scope and Functions
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with var.

#### Local Scope and Functions
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means, they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

```
function myTest() {
  var loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}
myTest(); // logs "foo"
console.log(loc); // loc is not defined
```

loc is not defined outside of the function.

#### Global vs. Local Scope in Functions

It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

In this example:

```
var someVar = "Hat";
function myFun() {
  var someVar = "Head";
  return someVar;
}
```

The function myFun will return "Head" because the local version of the variable is present.

Return a Value from a Function with Return
We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example

```
function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}
var answer = plusThree(5); // 8
```

plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

#### Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example
```
var sum = 0;
function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}
```
addSum(3); // sum will be modified but returned value is undefined
addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

#### Assignment with a Returned Value
If you'll recall from our discussion of Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:

ourSum = sum(5, 12);

will call sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to ourSum variable.

#### Stand in Line
In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments.

Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.

The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.

#### Understanding Boolean Values
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note
Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

#### Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode

if (condition is true) {
  statement is executed
}
Example

```
function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
     return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}
test(true);  // returns "It was true"
test(false); // returns "It was false"
```

When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns "It was true". When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns "It was false".

#### Comparison with the Equality Operator
There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left.

```
function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
     return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
```

If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return "Equal". Otherwise, the function will return "Not Equal". In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as "Type Coercion". Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

1   ==  1   // true
1   ==  2   // false
1   == '1'  // true
"3" ==  3   // true

#### Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

Examples
```
3 ===  3   // true
3 === '3'  // false
```
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.

#### In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:

typeof 3   // returns 'number'
typeof '3' // returns 'string'

#### Comparison with the Inequality Operator
The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
```
Examples

1 !=  2     // true
1 != "1"    // false
1 != '1'    // false
1 != true   // false
0 != false  // false
```

#### Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator
The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. Strict inequality will not convert data types.
```
Examples

3 !==  3   // false
3 !== '3'  // true
4 !==  3   // true
```

#### Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
```
Examples

5   >  3   // true
7   > '3'  // true
2   >  3   // false
'1' >  9   // false
```

#### Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.
```
Examples

6   >=  6   // true
7   >= '3'  // true
2   >=  3   // false
'7' >=  9   // false
```

#### Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:
```
if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
```
will only return "Yes" if num is greater than 5 and less than 10. The same logic can be written as:
```
if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";
```
#### Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:

if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";
will return "Yes" only if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written as:

if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";


#### Introducing Else Statements
When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

```
if (num > 10) {
  return "Bigger than 10";
} else {
  return "10 or Less";
}
```
#### Introducing Else If Statements
If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together with else if statements.

```
if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}
```

#### Logical Order in If Else Statements
Order is important in if, else if statements.

The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.

Take these two functions as an example.

Here's the first:
```
function foo(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```
And the second just switches the order of the statements:
```
function bar(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```
While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.
```
foo(0) // "Less than one"
bar(0) // "Less than two"
```
#### Chaining If Else Statements
if/else statements can be chained together for complex logic. Here is pseudocode of multiple chained if / else if statements:

```
if (condition1) {
  statement1
} else if (condition2) {
  statement2
} else if (condition3) {
  statement3
. . .
} else {
  statementN
}
```
#### Golf Code

```
var names = ["Hole-in-one!", "Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Go Home!"];
function golfScore(par, strokes) {
  // Only change code below this line
   if (strokes == 1) {
    return names[0]
  } else if (strokes <= par - 2) {
    return names[1]
  } else if (strokes == par - 1) {
    return names[2]
  } else if (strokes == par) {
    return names[3]
  } else if (strokes == par + 1) {
    return names[4]
  } else if (strokes == par + 2) {
    return names[5]
  } else if (strokes >= par + 3) {
    return names[6]
  }
}

console.log(golfScore(4, 2));
```

#### Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

```
switch(lowercaseLetter) {
  case "a":
    console.log("A");
    break;
  case "b":
    console.log("B");
    break;
}
```

case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

#### Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.

A default statement should be the last case.

```
switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
}
```
#### Exercise:
Write a switch statement to set answer for the following conditions:
"a" - "apple"
"b" - "bird"
"c" - "cat"
default - "stuff"

#### Answer

```
function switchOfStuff(val) {
  var answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (val) {
  case "a": 
  answer = "apple";
  break;
  case "b": 
  answer = "bird";
  break;
  case "c": 
  answer = "cat";
  break;
  default:
  answer = "stuff"
  break;
}
  return answer;
}

console.log(switchOfStuff("c"));
```


#### Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:

```
switch(val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}
```
Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

#### Example 

```
function sequentialSizes(val) {
  var answer = "";
  
  switch (val) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3: 
      answer = "Low"
      break;
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      answer = "Mid"
      break;
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9: 
      answer = "High"
  }
  return answer;
}

// Change this value to test
console.log(sequentialSizes(7));
```

#### Replacing If Else Chains with Switch
If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many chained if/else if statements. The following:
```
if (val === 1) {
  answer = "a";
} else if (val === 2) {
  answer = "b";
} else {
  answer = "c";
}
```
can be replaced with:

```
switch(val) {
  case 1:
    answer = "a";
    break;
  case 2:
    answer = "b";
    break;
  default:
    answer = "c";
}
```

#### Example

```
function chainToSwitch(val) {
  var answer = "";

   switch (val) {
    case "bob":
     answer = "Marley";
      break;
    case 1: 
      answer = "There is no #1";
      break;
    case 99:
      answer = "Missed me by this much!";
      break; 
    case 7: 
      answer = "Ate Nine"; 
      break;
    case 42:
      answer = "The Answer";
   }
  return answer;
}

console.log(chainToSwitch(42));
```
#### Returning Boolean Values from Functions
You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.

Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:
```
function isEqual(a,b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:
```
function isEqual(a,b) {
  return a === b;
}
```
Example:
```
function isLess(a, b) {
  return a < b; 
}

console.log(isLess(9, 15));
```
returns true

#### Early Pattern for Functions
When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.

Example
```
function myFun() {
  console.log("Hello");
  return "World";
  console.log("byebye")
}
myFun();
```
The above outputs "Hello" to the console, returns "World", but "byebye" is never output, because the function exits at the return statement.

#### CHALLENGE: Counting Cards
In the casino game Blackjack, a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

```
Count Change	Cards
+1 =	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
 0 =	7, 8, 9
-1 =	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
```

You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

Example Output
```
-3 Hold
5 Bet
```

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
Do NOT return an array.
Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.

#### My Solution 
```
var count = 0;

function cc(card) {

 if (card == 2) {
   count ++;
  } 
  else if (card == 3){
   count ++; 
  }
 else if (card == 4){
   count ++;
 }
 else if (card == 5){
   count ++;
 }
 else if (card == 6){
   count ++;
 }
  else if (card == 10){
   count --;
 }
  else if (card == "J"){
    count--;
  }
  else if (card == "Q"){
    count--;
  } 
  else if (card == "K"){
    count--;
  } 
  else if (card == "A"){
    count--;
  }

  var holdbet = 'Hold'
  if (count > 0) {
    holdbet = 'Bet'
  }
  return count + " " + holdbet;
}

cc(2); cc('K'); cc(10); cc('K'); cc('A');
```

#### Given Solution 
```
var count = 0;

function cc(card) {
  switch(card) {
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      count++;
      break;
    case 10:
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
    case "A":
      count--;
      break;
  }

  var holdbet = 'Hold'
  if (count > 0) {
    holdbet = 'Bet'
  }

  return count + " " + holdbet;

}

cc(2); cc('K'); cc(10); cc('K'); cc('A');
console.log(cc(4))
```

#### Build JavaScript Objects
You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Here's a sample cat object:
```
var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
```
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as - "name", "legs", and "tails". However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:
```
var anotherObject = {
  make: "Ford",
  5: "five",
  "model": "focus"
};
```
However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.

#### Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:
```
var myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2
```

#### Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:
```
var myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};
myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj['More Space']; // Spock
myObj["NoSpace"];    // USS Enterprise
```
Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

#### Accessing Object Properties with Variables
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:
```
var dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};
var myDog = "Hunter";
var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"
```
Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected dynamically during the program execution, as follows:
```
var someObj = {
  propName: "John"
};
function propPrefix(str) {
  var s = "prop";
  return s + str;
}
```
```
var someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"
```
Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.
