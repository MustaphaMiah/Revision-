Revising HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript

                                                                                          

Notes:

The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.

In addition to pixels, you can also specify the border-radius using a percentage.

In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.
There are several benefits to using id attributes: You can use an id to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.

Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties individually, you can specify them all in one line, like this:
padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;

The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units of length. For example, in and mm refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.

Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value. For example, em is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size.

The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.
The box-shadow property takes values for

* offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
* offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
* blur-radius,
* spread-radius and
* color, in that order.

The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.
Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.
Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:

The text-transform property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.
The following table shows how the different text-transformvalues change the example text "Transform me".

Value	Result
lowercase	"transform me"
uppercase	"TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize	"Transform Me"
initial	Use the default value
inherit	Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none	Default: Use the original text

CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function. Here is the general syntax:
background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);
The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a vertical gradient and 45deg is angled like a backslash. The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.
Example:
background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));

By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of an element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

You may recall from an earlier challenge that the box-shadow property takes values for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:

animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.

animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.

@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene.

``` <style>
  div {
    height: 40px;
    width: 70%;
    background: black;
    margin: 50px auto;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }

  #rect {
    animation-name: rainbow; 
    animation-duration: 4s;  
  }

  @keyframes rainbow {
    0% {
      background-color: blue; 
    }
    50% {
      background-color: green;
    }
    100% {
      background-color: yellow;
    }
  }
  }

</style>
<div id="rect"></div>
```
You can use CSS @keyframes to change the color of a button in its hover state.

Here's an example of changing the background colour of the button element on hover:

``` 
<style>
  button {
    border-radius: 5px;
    color: white;
    background-color: #0F5897;
    padding: 5px 10px 8px 10px;
  }

  button:hover {
    animation-name: background-color;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
  }

   @keyframes background-color {
    100% {
      background-color: #4791d0;
    }
  }



</style>

<button>Register</button>
```
Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:
animation-iteration-count: 3;


Applied Accessibility

It's likely that you've seen an alt attribute on an img tag in other challenges. Alt text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative for it. This helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an example:

<img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo">

People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.

Good alt text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include an alt attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.

Headings (h1 through h6 elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values.

HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.

By default, a browser renders these elements similarly to the humble div. However, using them where appropriate gives additional meaning in your markup. The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content. Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.

The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic of your page. It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.

article is another one of the new HTML5 elements that adds semantic meaning to your markup. article is a sectioning element, and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.

The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.


The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the header tag. It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.

header shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with main, allowing assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content.

Note: The header is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.

The nav element is another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation. This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in your page.

If there are repeated site links at the bottom of the page, it isn't necessary to markup those with a nav tag as well. Using a footer (covered in the next challenge) is sufficient.

Similar to header and nav, the footer element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page.

HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on

Example:

```
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
```

Note: Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.

HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption. Used together, these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the figure.

For data visualizations like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for users with visual impairments. Another challenge covers how to move a table version of the chart's data off-screen (using CSS) for screen reader users.

Here's an example - note that the figcaption goes inside the figure tags and can be combined with other elements:HTML5 introduced the figure element, along with the related figcaption.
